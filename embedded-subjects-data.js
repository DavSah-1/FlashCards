Imitation (replicating the behaviour of others) as outlined by SLT, depends on 2 factors which makes imitation more likely: vicarious reinforcement (indirect learning through observation of consequences of another person’s behaviour) and identification (extent to which person relates to individual being observed eg. Same sex, high status.)

Cognitive processes such as attention, retention, motor reproduction and motivation as theorised by Bandura involve noticing behaviour, remembering it, being able to reproduce the behaviour and the desire to do so. This would suggest that humans don’t solely learn by personal experience, but also by observing the consequences of other’s actions when deciding how to further behave (VR.) Moreover, the theory of mediational processes support SLT as it is a more comprehensive explanation of human behaviour than classical and operant conditioning, therefore acting as a valuable extension to behaviourism in the world of psychology. \nDespite this, a weakness of  SLT is that it does not consider biological factors in learning. For example, Bandura’s findings in his research concerning observational learning may actually be a result of  mirror neurones in the brain which allow us to empathise with and imitate others. This suggests that SLT is not a fully comprehensive learning theory as biology is under-emphasised.",

This suggests that children are incredibly impressionable and this evidence has proved to be invaluable in understanding our society and working towards making the world a better place. This was demonstrated through the changing of times when explicit movies (eg. Swearing, horror genre etc.) were shown in order to limit exposure to children, as well as the increase in age ratings on video games which involve violence. These media changes work to decrease violence and anti-social behaviour as a direct result of Bandura’s shocking findings used as evidence to support SLT, outlining the significance of SLT in ameliorating society.",

As well as this, the Bobo doll used can be said to be a demand characteristic (cues in a study which may reveal true purpose to participants, leading to altered behaviour) as its main purpose is to be hit, an act of aggression. This adds an extra variable which influences aggressive behaviour, therefore reducing the validity of the experiment as a clear cause and effect relationship becomes less defined.

This is a strength because of the ease with which they can be understood due to the simple flow diagram format. Eg, input -> mental event -> output\n\tOne limitation is that mental processes is not directly observed, given that inferences are indirectly concluded about observable behaviour. This suggests that the approach is less valid as it is not based on observable fact. \n\tOne limitation is that it could be criticised as being overly mechanistic eg.

The PNS is then sub-divided into the Autonomic nervous system (ANS) which controls vital involuntary actions such as heartbeat and digestion and the somatic nervous system (SNS) which regulates voluntary actions such as skeletal muscle movement. The ANS is finally split up into the sympathetic NS which is responsible for the “fight or flight” response and parasympathetic NS which is responsible for the “rest and digest” response.",

ISI is closely linked to internalisation (a deep, permanent type of conformity) as it involves wanting to be right, so you start believing the actions are correct and as a result you change your personal and public opinions to that of the majority. An example of ISI could be going on an LGBTQ+ march with a group of your friends who support the movement and subsequently changing your private views permanently in favour of the LGBTQ+ community. NSI is closely linked to compliance, a surface-level, temporary type of conformity) as it involves wanting to fit in, so differing personal views are maintained in private but altered to fit the majority in public.

This evidence shows how informational social influence may not be an explanation of conformity for everyone as people who are more confident in their knowledge (eg. Science students)/ are not necessarily in an ambiguous situation so are less likely to conform.) Overall perhaps this evidence suggests that not everyone is influenced by ISI in the same manner, and different groups of people may be more or less likely to conform as a result of informational social influence.

Eg. Traditional - everyone did similar things, married at 20, 2.4 kids each and standing out was an issue. Therefore less valid due to difference in time frame study conducted as nowadays being a disruptor is celebrated and people lead more varied and modern lifestyles, so asch’s results may not be consistent across time and may only be relevant to the 1950s.\n-/+)can’t be validly generalised: Perrin and spencer replicated aschs study with engineering students in UK in 1980 and found they were less conformist (only 1 conformed to of 360) because they had more confidence in their own abilities when measuring lines. This suggests that factors affecting conformity impact people differently which can depend on their course/skills. Therefore this contradicted aschs experiment as results were much lower, however it could support aschs hypothesis which considers the relation of task difficulty when measuring conformity.\n-/+)artificial research which lacks eternal validity: lab experiment means pts weren’t in natural environment combined with use of demand characteristics (obviousness of confederates incorrect answers) leads to increased likelihood of abnormal behaviour - result less valid. Lacks mundane realism as task was not reflective of tasks performed in every day life, therefore cannot be used as completely comprehensive evidence for conformity in real life. However, use of lab meant highly controlled, so internal validity was high resulting in a clear cause and effect relationship concerning the IV and DV in the study.  \n-/+) ethics: to evaluate study, cost benefit analysis. Whilst pts were deceived right from the beginning as asch didn’t tell them true aim of study, this would’ve likely caused them to act based upon how they believe they should act and not how they subconsciously would in the real world (abnormal behaviour) so more benefit as otherwise study would’ve been invalid. Bc true aim wasn’t revealed, no informed consent so this was violated but was outweighed by abnormal behaviour threat. No psychological harm and distress other than embarrassment and uncomfortable potentially. Privacy and confidentiality was for the most part maintained.

This shows that once participants perceived they were no longer responsible for their own behaviour. They acted more willingly as the experimenters  agent.\n-) Agentic shift cannot explain the results of Milgrim‘s variations because the extent to which obedience rates varied suggests obedience is a product of situational variables rather than situational explanations. For example the genetic state explanation would predict high levels of obedience regardless of the situation whereas obedience in practice varied. This suggests that all characteristics of the situation must be taken into account rather than simply situational explanations like the agentic shift.\n+) it can be applied to the real world as it can explain cultural differences through legitimacy of authority theory. E.g. many study show in different countries Beedie rates differ e.g. mann and Kilham found only 16% of Australians went all the way to 450 V whereas Mantell found 85% of Germans did so. this shows how in some cultures authority is more likely to be accepted as legitimate and entitled to demand obedience such as in individualistic cultures or in collectivist cultures. This reflects the way the different societies are structured and the differences in how children are raised to perceive authority figures and therefore can be used as an explanation for obedience.\n-) not fully comprehensive as cannot explain all disobedience e.g. Rankin Jacobson study most were disobedient despite working in a hierarchical authority structure also despite being a minority 35% of Milgrim participants disobeyed despite recognising the experimental scientifical authority. This suggests that some people may be influence differently by the legitimacy of an authority figure or by the genetic state or perhaps that situational explanations interact with situational and dispositional variables in order to fully explain obedience. There’s also can be dangerous theory e.g. Agentic state as it reduces the responsibility and accountability taken for harmful actions which can be applied to the real world because if everybody thought that they can do authority’s wishes without consequences or personal liability, it would be an excuse to do any harmful action and get away with it.",

Adorno argued that these childhood experience create resentment and hostility in a child however the child cannot express feelings directly because they fear punishment so fizz are displaced onto others who they perceive to be weaker through scapegoating.

        "definition": "+) one strength is evidence from Milgrim study supporting the AP. Milgrim alongside elms interviewed a small sample who had participated in the original obedience studies and being fully obedient they completed the F scale as part of the interview. These 20 participants scored significantly higher on the overall S scale and a comparison group of 20 disobedient participants the two groups were clearly quite different in terms of authoritarianism. This finding supports Adornos view that obedient people show similar characteristics to people who have an AP.\nCounterpoint ) however when the researchers analyse their individual sub skills of the F scale they found obedient participants had a number of characteristics that were unusual for authoritarians e.g. they did not glorify their fathers generally or experience unusually high levels of punishment in childhood or did not have particularly hostile attitudes towards their mothers. This means that the link between obedience and authoritarianism is complex so AP is unlikely to be a useful predictor of obedience.\n-) one limitation is the AP cannot explain obedient behaviour in the majority of a countries population e.g. in pre-war Germany millions of people display obedient and antisemitic behaviour. This was regardless of differing personalities so it’s impossible. They all possess an AP and alternative views that the majority of people identified with the antisemitic Nazi state and Scape goat the outgroup Jewish people a social identity theory approach. Therefore, a Dorno theory is limited because an alternative explanation is much more realistic.\n-) another limitation is the F scale only captures one kind of authoritarianism so it is an incomplete explanation. This is because it measures the tendency towards extreme right wing politics however.Mallinas suggest the F scale actually measures two elements: submission and traditionalism. Because only submission is strong and left-wing authoritarians while both are strong and right wing authoritarian submission is the key element in authoritarian behaviour and therefore Adornos theory cannot explain all historical incidents of destructive obedience.\nEducation may determine authoritarianism and obedience as research generally find the less educated or consistently more authoritarian e.g. Milgrim found participants with lower levels of education tended to be more obedient. This suggests that instead of authoritarianism causing obedience lack of education could be responsible for both authoritarianism and obedience. \nResearch is correlational: Adorno found many significant correlation between authoritarianism and prejudice however no matter how strongly correlated the variables it doesn’t show that one variable cause the effect on the other so unidentified distinct cause-and-effect relationship",
